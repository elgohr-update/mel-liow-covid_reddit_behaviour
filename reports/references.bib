	abstract={COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China in December of 2019 and appeared in the United States 1 month later. Between the onset of the pandemic and January 13, 2021, over 92 million people have tested positive for the virus and over 1.9 million people have died globally. Virtually every country in the world has been impacted by this virus. Beginning in March 2020, many U.S. state governments enforced a “quarantine” to respond to the growing health crisis. Citizens were required to remain at home; schools, restaurants, and non-essential businesses were forced to close, and large gatherings were prohibited. Americans' lives were transformed in a span of days as daily routines were interrupted and people were shuttered indoors. Mounting fear and unpredictability coupled with widespread unemployment and social isolation escalated anxiety and impacted the mental health of millions across the globe. Most (53%) U.S. adults reported that the coronavirus outbreak has had a negative impact on their mental health, including inducing or exacerbating use of alcohol, drugs, gambling and overeating as coping mechanisms. In this paper, we will examine substance use and addictive behaviors that have been used to manage the stress and uncertainty wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. We review the changing treatment landscape as therapy pivoted online and telemedicine became the norm.}

	abstract = {COVID-19 has affected daily life in unprecedented ways. Drawing on a longitudinal dataset of college students before and during the pandemic, we document dramatic changes in physical activity, sleep, time use, and mental health. We show that biometric and time-use data are critical for understanding the mental health impacts of COVID-19, as the pandemic has tightened the link between lifestyle behaviors and depression. Our findings also suggest a puzzle: Disruptions to physical activity and mental health are strongly associated, but restoration of physical activity through a short-term intervention does not help improve mental health. These results highlight the large impact of COVID-19 on both lifestyle and well-being and offer directions for interventions aimed at restoring mental health.Using a longitudinal dataset linking biometric and survey data from several cohorts of young adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (N=682), we document large disruptions to physical activity, sleep, time use, and mental health. At the onset of the pandemic, average steps decline from 10,000 to 4,600 steps per day, sleep increases by 25 to 30 min per night, time spent socializing declines by over half to less than 30 min, and screen time more than doubles to over 5 h per day. Over the course of the pandemic from March to July 2020 the proportion of participants at risk for clinical depression ranges from 46\% to 61\%, up to a 90\% increase in depression rates compared to the same population just prior to the pandemic. Our analyses suggest that disruption to physical activity is a leading risk factor for depression during the pandemic. However, restoration of those habits through a short-term intervention does not meaningfully improve mental well-being.Anonymized data have been deposited in Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/f85e3/) (33).},

    abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic triggered vast governmental lockdowns. The impact of these lockdowns on mental health is inadequately understood. On the one hand such drastic changes in daily routines could be detrimental to mental health. On the other hand, it might not be experienced negatively, especially because the entire population was affected.   Methods The aim of this study was to determine mental health outcomes during pandemic induced lockdowns and to examine known predictors of mental health outcomes. We therefore surveyed n = 9,565 people from 78 countries and 18 languages. Outcomes assessed were stress, depression, affect, and wellbeing. Predictors included country, sociodemographic factors, lockdown characteristics, social factors, and psychological factors.   Results Results indicated that on average about 10% of the sample was languishing from low levels of mental health and about 50% had only moderate mental health. Importantly, three consistent predictors of mental health emerged: social support, education level, and psychologically flexible (vs. rigid) responding. Poorer outcomes were most strongly predicted by a worsening of finances and not having access to basic supplies.   Conclusions These results suggest that on whole, respondents were moderately mentally healthy at the time of a population-wide lockdown. The highest level of mental health difficulties were found in approximately 10% of the population. Findings suggest that public health initiatives should target people without social support and those whose finances worsen as a result of the lockdown. Interventions that promote psychological flexibility may mitigate the impact of the pandemic.},

abstract = {Correlation and association analyses are one of the most widely used statistical methods in research fields, including microbiome and integrative multiomics studies. Correlation and association have two implications: dependence and co-occurrence. Microbiome data are structured as phylogenetic tree and have several unique characteristics, including high dimensionality, compositionality, sparsity with excess zeros, and heterogeneity. These unique characteristics cause several statistical issues when analyzing microbiome data and integrating multiomics data, such as large p and small n, dependency, overdispersion, and zero-inflation. In microbiome research, on the one hand, classic correlation and association methods are still applied in real studies and used for the development of new methods; on the other hand, new methods have been developed to target statistical issues arising from unique characteristics of microbiome data. Here, we first provide a comprehensive view of classic and newly developed univariate correlation and association-based methods. We discuss the appropriateness and limitations of using classic methods and demonstrate how the newly developed methods mitigate the issues of microbiome data. Second, we emphasize that concepts of correlation and association analyses have been shifted by introducing network analysis, microbe-metabolite interactions, functional analysis, etc. Third, we introduce multivariate correlation and association-based methods, which are organized by the categories of exploratory, interpretive, and discriminatory analyses and classification methods. Fourth, we focus on the hypothesis testing of univariate and multivariate regression-based association methods, including alpha and beta diversities-based, count-based, and relative abundance (or compositional)-based association analyses. We demonstrate the characteristics and limitations of each approaches. Fifth, we introduce two specific microbiome-based methods: phylogenetic tree-based association analysis and testing for survival outcomes. Sixth, we provide an overall view of longitudinal methods in analysis of microbiome and omics data, which cover standard, static, regression-based time series methods, principal trend analysis, and newly developed univariate overdispersed and zero-inflated as well as multivariate distance/kernel-based longitudinal models. Finally, we comment on current association analysis and future direction of association analysis in microbiome and multiomics studies.}
