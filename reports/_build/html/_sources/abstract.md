# Analysing Reddit Behaviour during the COVID Pandemic
## Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely and disproportionately impacted people suffering from mental health issues and substance use problems{cite:p}`DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2011-10518`. Fear and unpredictability coupled with widespread unemployment and social isolation has escalated anxiety and impacted the mental health of millions around the world{cite:p}`Giuntellae2016632118`. Additionally, the social stigma associated with mental health and substance abuse has led to a reluctancy in sharing struggles and seeking help {cite:p}`10.3389/fpsyt.2021.653674`. Many have turned to social media as a medium for people to talk about their experiences and their struggles. Reddit, ranked the 9th most popular social media app in the US, is a platform that provides focused forums (subreddits) where users can subscribe and post anonymously.
In this report we analysed 15 different subreddits to determine whether the median number of references to substance abuse per user post has changed between the time period _pre COVID-19_ (2018-2019) and _during COVID-19_ (2020 onwards). More specifically, we used the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test as the statistical inference method for hypothesis testing and deduced that only two subreddits, _r/lonely_ and _r/adhd_, showed a statistically significant difference in median number of references with p-values less than the significance level of $\alpha=0.05$. These values were 0.003 and 0.04 respectively.
This analysis helps to understand the correlation between the effect of the pandemic on Reddit users. With further research and improvement, this study could lend itself useful to determine a suitable statistical model that can help online forums target groups of vulenerable people suffering from substance abuse or other mental health disorders.
